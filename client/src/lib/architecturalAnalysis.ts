  originalArchitecture: {
    dataFiles: "All stored in dot format 'Gen.1:1' in Supabase Storage",
    intention: "Simple, consistent format throughout system",
    reality: "Multiple layers of defensive conversions added over time"

    {
      phase: "Phase 1: Original Clean Design",
      description: "Files stored as 'Gen.1:1', system used dot format",
      status: "CLEAN PIPELINE"
    },
    {
      phase: "Phase 2: Display Requirements", 
      description: "UI team wanted 'Gen 1:1' for traditional biblical reference display",
      action: "Added .replace('.', ' ') for display only",
      problem: "Started format divergence"
    },
    {
      phase: "Phase 3: Lookup Failures",
      description: "Some components failed to find data with space format",
      action: "Added defensive .replace(' ', '.') conversions",
      problem: "Created conversion loops"
    },
    {
      phase: "Phase 4: Cross-Reference Integration",
      description: "Cross-refs needed to work with both formats",
      action: "Added multiple format attempts in lookup functions",
      problem: "Exponential format variation attempts"
    },
    {
      phase: "Phase 5: Strong's Integration", 
      description: "Strong's data needed verse references for lookup",
      action: "Added 6 different format variations to 'guarantee' matches",
      problem: "Performance death spiral - 6x regex operations per lookup"
    },
    {
      phase: "Phase 6: Defensive Programming",
      description: "Developers lost confidence in format consistency",
      action: "Added 'safety' conversions everywhere 'just in case'",
      problem: "Every component doing redundant conversions"
    }

  whyItStillWorked: {
    reason: "JavaScript string operations are fast enough to mask the problem",
    reality: "31,102 verses √ó multiple conversions = thousands of wasted operations",
    userExperience: "Slightly slower loads, but functional",
    developerExperience: "Confusing, defensive code everywhere"
  },
  
  theRealProblem: {
    issue: "Loss of Single Source of Truth",
    consequence: "No one trusted the data format, so everyone converted defensively",
    result: "Classic technical debt - working but inefficient system"
  }
