## **Forum Safety & Scam Prevention**

**Protecting the Body of Christ from Harmful Practices**

At Anointed.io, we’re committed to building a safe, respectful, and Christ-centered space for study, fellowship, and encouragement. While we encourage generosity, we must also guard against those who might exploit this community.

**Our Policy on Financial Requests:**

1. **No direct solicitations for personal financial aid** are allowed in public posts, comments, or private messages unless explicitly approved by our moderators.
2. All giving or “Pay It Forward” requests must go through our **official, vetted channels** (such as the Anointed.io Gifted Profile Program).
3. **Do not send money, personal financial information, or login details** to another member outside these official systems.

**Our Commitment to Your Safety:**

* At **Anointed.io**, we will **never ask you for your personal information or your password**.
* If you ever receive a message claiming to be from our team that asks for this, **do not respond**.
* Please **report these attempts immediately** to our moderation team.

**How to Respond to Financial or Information Requests:**

* If you receive an unsolicited request for money or personal information, **do not respond**.
* Report the message immediately using the “Report” function or by emailing **[security@anointed.io](mailto:security@anointed.io)**.
* Our moderation team will investigate and take appropriate action.

**Why This Matters:**

* The Church is called to care for one another (Acts 2:44–45), but also to be wise stewards (Matthew 10:16).
* Protecting against fraudulent appeals and phishing attempts ensures that genuine needs are met through trusted, Spirit-led channels.
