**Payments**

**1. Subscription Pricing**
1.1 Anointed.io currently offers two plans:
Free Access â€“ Includes all public-domain Bible translations and core study tools.
$10/month Subscription â€“ Unlocks licensed translations, a personal Bible profile, and premium study features.
1.2 All prices are listed in U.S. dollars (USD) unless otherwise stated.

**2. Billing & Renewal**
2.1 Monthly Plan â€“ Your card will be charged immediately upon signup and on the same calendar day each month thereafter.
2.2 Annual Plan (if available) â€“ Your card will be charged immediately upon signup and on the same calendar day each year thereafter.
2.3 All subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled before the next billing date.
2.4 Canceling stops future charges; you will retain full access until the end of your current paid period.

**3. Failed Payments**
3.1 If a payment fails, we will attempt to reprocess it up to three (3) times within seven (7) days.
3.2 If all reattempts fail, your subscription will enter Paused mode. While paused, you can still log in and view your saved notes, highlights, and bookmarks, but you will not be able to add or edit content. Paused mode means you retain account data, but cannot access premium features until payment is updated.
3.3 You may reactivate your subscription at any time by updating your payment method. Once payment is successfully processed, full access will be restored immediately.

**4. Refund Policy**
4.1 Refund Window â€“ We offer a 7-day refund period for first-time subscription charges. If you request a refund within that time, weâ€™ll return your full payment.
4.2 After 7 Days â€“ Subscription fees are non-refundable once the 7-day period has passed.
4.3 Cancel Anytime â€“ If you cancel, your Bible profile isnâ€™t deleted â€” itâ€™s paused. Your notes, highlights, and bookmarks are safely stored for up to 12 months so you can pick up right where you left off if you decide to return.
