## **Public Page — Anointed.io Community Spaces (Coming Soon)**

> “As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another.” — Proverbs 27:17

We believe the Body grows stronger when believers have a place to share what God is showing them, encourage one another, and speak truth in love.

Right now, we’re building simple ways for our community to connect while we prepare something more deeply integrated into Anointed.io itself.

When it’s ready, you can expect:

* **Scripture-rooted conversations** guided by grace and truth.
* **Interactive participation** in shaping the direction of our platform.
* **A safe environment** where your voice matters and is respected.

**How to Get Involved Today**

* Keep an eye on our updates — we’ll share how to join early conversations before the integrated community space launches.
* Sign up for a Bible profile so you’re first in line for early invitations.

**Community Principles**

* Speak truth in love (Ephesians 4:15)
* Back all teachings with Scripture and context
* Honor each other above yourself (Romans 12:10)

Full guidelines will be available when the platform opens.
