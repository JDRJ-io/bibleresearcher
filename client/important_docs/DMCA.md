### 2. Counter-Notification Procedure

If you believe your material was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may send a counter-notification to our DMCA Agent that includes:

* Your name, address, phone number, and email.
* Identification of the material that has been removed or disabled and the location where it appeared before removal.
* A statement, under penalty of perjury, that you have a good-faith belief the material was removed or disabled due to mistake or misidentification.
* A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for your judicial district (or if outside the U.S., for any judicial district where Anointed.io may be found), and that you will accept service of process from the person who filed the original DMCA notice or their agent.

Upon receiving a valid counter-notification, we may restore the removed content unless the original complaining party files a court action seeking to restrain the user from engaging in the allegedly infringing activity.
