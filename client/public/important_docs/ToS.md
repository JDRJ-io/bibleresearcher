4.2 **Account Data:** Canceling or pausing any future subscription (once active) will not delete your Bible profile or study data. Notes, highlights, and bookmarks will remain stored in accordance with our **Data Retention Policy**.

4.3 **Deletion Requests:** Full account deletion may only be initiated by the original account holder (“Original Signee”) through the process outlined in our **Privacy Policy**.

**Note:** During the beta and pre-launch phase, payment systems (including refunds) remain disabled. Data retention and deletion policies may be refined as the platform progresses toward public release.
