*(Public – Anointed.io Account Deletion Policy)*

## **Delete Your Anointed.io Account**

We respect your right to control your data. If you wish to delete your account, here’s how the process works.

---

### 1️⃣ How to Request Deletion

Send an email to **[support@anointed.io](mailto:support@anointed.io)** from the **email address associated with your account**, with the subject line:
**“Delete My Account”**

For security reasons, we cannot process deletion requests from any other email.

---

### 2️⃣ What Happens When We Delete Your Account

* Your **profile, bookmarks, highlights, notes, and forum posts** will be permanently removed from your account.
* Some minimal records may remain for **legal, billing, or fraud-prevention purposes** (e.g., past subscription receipts).
* Once deleted, your account **cannot be restored.**

---

### 3️⃣ Timeline

* Account deletions are usually processed within **7 business days**.
* You’ll receive a confirmation email once completed.

---

### 4️⃣ Retained Community Content

If you’ve posted in public forums or shared insights, we may **anonymize** that content rather than deleting it entirely, to preserve the continuity of community discussions.

### During the pre-launch phase (effective August 30, 2025), deletion processes may be adjusted based on pre-launch phase feedback.
---

### 5️⃣ Legal Compliance

This policy is designed to comply with data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
