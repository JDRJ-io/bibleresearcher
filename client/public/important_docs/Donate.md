At **Anointed.io**, our mission is simple: make powerful Bible study tools available to every believer, everywhere — **completely free to access.**

Your donations keep the servers running, support licensing for premium Bible translations, and help us build new features for the global Body of Christ.

When you give, you’re not just funding software.
You’re helping believers:

* **Engage Scripture deeply** — with original languages, cross-references, and prophecy tools.
* **Share insights freely** — so that the voice of the Church can be heard.
* **Grow together in unity** — across nations, denominations, and generations.
