## **Accessibility Statement**

At Anointed.io, we are committed to making God’s Word accessible to everyone. We want all people — regardless of ability — to be able to study Scripture and use our tools with ease.

### 1️⃣ Our Commitment

* We aim to follow the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1** to the best of our ability.
* Our design choices (contrast, font sizes, responsive layouts) are made with accessibility in mind.
* We are continuously improving features like keyboard navigation and screen-reader compatibility.

### 2️⃣ Known Limitations

While we strive for full accessibility, some advanced features (e.g., draggable columns, visual effects, or community forum content) may not be fully optimized for all assistive technologies.

### 3️⃣ Requesting Assistance
