### During the pre-launch phase (effective August 30, 2025), email delivery is currently handled via GoDaddy/Outlook, with a planned migration to AWS SES. This transition will maintain the same email addresses (e.g., support@anointed.io, privacy@anointed.io). Data sharing will be updated as additional services are deployed.
