If you believe your material was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may send a counter-notification to our DMCA Agent that includes:

* Your name, address, phone number, and email.

* A statement, under penalty of perjury, that you have a good-faith belief the material was removed or disabled due to mistake or misidentification.

Upon receiving a valid counter-notification, we may restore the removed content unless the original complaining party files a court action seeking to restrain the user from engaging in the allegedly infringing activity.
