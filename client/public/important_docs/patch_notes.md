Welcome to the most comprehensive Bible study platform, now with powerful new features and enhancements.

## 🎮 Smart Scrollbar & Joystick Navigation
Four intelligent scroll modes — **Global**, **Testament**, **Book**, and **Section** — mapped perfectly to Scripture layout. **Joystick mode** (mobile & tablet): intuitive thumb navigation with smooth directional scrolling. **Velocity-aware zooming** lets you "glide through the Bible" with precision, while dwell detection locks to key sections automatically.

## 🧠 Adaptive Performance Engine
**Device-aware optimization** ensures flawless scrolling across phones, tablets, and desktops. **Seamless verse preloading** and placeholder rendering eliminate blank frames entirely.

## 🔖 Bookmarks & Notes Reinvented
**Real-time sync** via Supabase with instant local save fallback. **Custom bookmark colors and names** — like a digital Bible marker. **Notes auto-save** safely even if you close the browser or lose connection.

## 💎 Glass-Morphism UI & Presentation Mode
A serene, **frosted-glass design** that emphasizes the Word without distractions. **Presentation Mode**: expand Scripture beautifully for teaching or devotional display. **Subtle prophecy-based glow effects** highlight fulfilled and unfulfilled promises.

## 🔍 Smarter Search & Reference Parsing
Type **"jn316"** or **"1cor13"** and instantly jump to the right verse. **Corrects typos automatically** ("Isaih" → Isaiah). Works with dot notation, abbreviations, and natural language input.

## 📚 Study Tools Expansion
**Strong's Concordance**: load Hebrew and Greek roots progressively with hover definitions. **Prophecy Columns**: grouped by Prediction, Fulfillment, and Verification for clear insight. **Semantic Labels**: contextual overlays for themes, cross-references, and fulfillment connections.

## 🧭 Master Column
Central **"context" view** showing everything about the current verse — prophecy links, Strong's data, and connected passages — without losing your place.
