## **Acknowledgments & Credits**

*Anointed.io — Bible Study Tools & Data Integration*

**As of:** November 1st, 2025

At Anointed.io, we believe in transparency and honor toward those who have laid foundations in biblical study resources. All datasets and tools on this site have been built through extensive research, original design, and careful integration of publicly available data, community contributions, and in-house development.

While much of our system is original creative work, we gratefully acknowledge the following foundational sources whose work has been instrumental in helping us create the features you see today.

---

### **1. Scripture Texts (Public Domain Translations)**

These translations are free to use commercially and form part of our verse display system.

* **King James Version (KJV)** — Public Domain.
* **World English Bible (WEB)** — Public Domain ([https://ebible.org/web/](https://ebible.org/web/)).
* **Young’s Literal Translation (YLT)** — Public Domain.

### **2. Morphological Tagging & Strong’s Data**

* **MorphGNT Project** — Greek New Testament morphological tagging ([https://github.com/morphgnt](https://github.com/morphgnt)), used for part-of-speech and parsing information in our Strong’s overlay for Greek texts.
**Creative Commons Attribution License**.
* **Strong’s Concordance Data** — Public Domain due to age of original work; our implementation is custom-formatted for interactive use.

---

### **3. Cross References**

* **Original Source:** OpenBible.info Cross References ([https://www.openbible.info/labs/cross-references/](https://www.openbible.info/labs/cross-references/)) — licensed under **Creative Commons Attribution License**.
* We have **adapted, reorganized, and ranked** these for context mapping to make them more navigable within our verse-by-verse framework.

---

### **4. Chronology & Historical Dating**

* Based on a synthesis of scholarly timelines and public-domain research including:

  * **E. W. Bullinger**
  * **The Treasury of Scripture Knowledge** (Public Domain)
  * **BibleHub Chronological Tools** ([https://biblehub.com/timeline/](https://biblehub.com/timeline/))
* Dates in Anointed.io are approximations unless otherwise historically fixed, and have been adapted into our own **Chronological Verse Order System**.

---

### **5. Prophecy Connections & Themes**

* Initial research inspiration drawn from **Encyclopedia of Biblical Prophecy** by J. Barton Payne (for thematic inspiration; no direct copyrighted content reproduced).
* OT/NT prediction–fulfillment-verification versev  pairings have been **expanded, verified, and reclassified** in-house into our own **Prophecy Theme Categorization System**.

---

### **6. In-House Pre-Launch Features (Original Creative Work)**

These features are 100% developed in-house and are currently in pre-launch phase:

* **Labels System** — Thematic and topical tagging across translations.
* **Context Boundaries** — Visual & logical groupings of scripture passages.
* **Strong’s Syntax Analysis** — Enhanced linking of morphological data to Strong’s entries.
* **Prophecy Theme Categorization** — Nine primary prophecy themes with sub-themes.

---

### **7. Research-Based Features (Community-Enhanced)**

These began with outside research data, but have been significantly adapted and improved:

* **Chronological Order & Dates** — Derived from multiple historical sources, now formatted into our unique ordering system.
* **Cross References & Relevance Hierarchy** — Expanded from OpenBible.info with verse-level weighting.
* **Prophecy Verse Connections** — Structuring of predictions, fulfillments, and verification verses.

---
