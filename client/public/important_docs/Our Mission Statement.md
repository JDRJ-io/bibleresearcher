# **Our Mission & Vision — Anointed.io**

## **For God’s Magnificent Glory**

Anointed.io exists as a foundation for the biblical community to come together — not to claim we have already attained the perfect arrangement of God’s Word, but to offer a starting point that the Lord has helped us prepare.
Through prayer, study, and the integration of many freely available and inspired works, we have built an interactive platform designed to connect Scripture’s vast truths into a more accessible, living framework.

We do not claim that the current arrangement is the final word on accuracy or completeness. Rather, we believe the layers we have created — enhanced indexing, thematic prophecy links, chronological mapping, Strong’s integration, and more — serve as tools that the community of believers can refine together for the glory of God.

This is not a monument to our work; it is scaffolding for the Body of Christ to build upon.

## **A Call to Build Together**

We invite you to:

* **Critique** what has been put together.
* **Join your quiet times here**, letting the Word speak to you.
* **Share the revelations** that the Holy Spirit gives you.
* **Connect Scripture in greater measure** as a living group of believers.

Our vision is to see believers of all ages, nations, and backgrounds contributing insights, corrections, and deeper connections — so that the Word of God may shine with ever greater clarity and depth to all who seek Him.

## **Our Unity in Christ**

We recognize that the Body of Christ is made up of believers from many backgrounds, traditions, and denominations. Yet Scripture reminds us that our identity is not in these divisions:

> *“For when one says, ‘I follow Paul,’ and another, ‘I follow Apollos,’ are you not being merely human? What then is Apollos? What is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, as the Lord assigned to each… Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?”* — 1 Corinthians 1:12-13

While we may have differing foundations of belief, **we all have the Holy Spirit to unify us into the full measure of Christ** (Ephesians 4:13). Denominations may differ in certain teachings or practices, but the Word of God unites us in one Lord, one faith, and one collective baptism (Ephesians 4:4-6).

Anointed.io is a place for believers of every tradition who confess Jesus Christ as Lord to come together to study, share, and grow — **not in the name of a denomination, but in the Name above every name**.

## **A Platform for the Bride**

We believe that as we grow in the Word and in fellowship, the Holy Spirit is preparing the Bride of Christ — the Church — to be made ready for His return (Revelation 19:7). Every verse we connect, every insight we share, and every truth we affirm together is part of this preparation.

### During the pre-launch phase (effective August 30, 2025), some features may be limited as we refine the platform for public access.
