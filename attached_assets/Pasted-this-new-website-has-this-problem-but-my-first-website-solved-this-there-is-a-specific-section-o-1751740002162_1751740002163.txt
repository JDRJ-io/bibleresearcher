this new website has this problem, but my first website solved this

there is a specific section of verses that load
if people start to scroll down and read the end of that section, it moves past the boundary of the verse section....it does loads new verses, but i feel like there are multiple factors moving in contrast with eachother that are both trying to get verses to load, and they are not in sync.
i want to make it so that no matter where a user scrolls, their middle verse is always retained, because people are scrolling outside of the boundaries of the verse columns, that's where the big white space is at the bottom of the page


1 What’s happening in the new build
| Symptom you see | Technical cause |
|‑|‑|
| Bottom of the page shows a big white band (no verses) | The container’s height is shorter than the product totalVerses × ROW_HEIGHT; when you scroll past that point the browser has nowhere to paint. |
| Scrolling “past the boundary” suddenly jumps, sometimes backfills verses twice | Two independent listeners are trying to refill rows:<br>  • your main scroll handler, and<br>  • a second handler (often an IntersectionObserver tied to the last row or a onScroll inside a nested div). They race, compute slightly different start/end indices, push duplicates or skip rows. |
| The verse in the middle of the screen shifts when new rows inject | You destroy all visible rows and rebuild the buffer, so scrollTop is unchanged but row heights above change, pushing content up or down. |

2 How the first prototype avoided every one of those issues
| Rule in the prototype | What it achieved |
|‑|‑|
| Fixed placeholder height: immediately after loading the verse‑key array it executed<br>container.style.height = totalVerses × ROW_HEIGHT | Perfect scrollbar — the browser never needed to measure or guess how tall the page might become. |
| Single scroll listener / early‑exit guard: there was exactly one scroll event bound to the outer div, and the top of updateVisibleRows() started with<br>if (clampedStart === currentStart && clampedEnd === currentEnd) return; | Prevented double work and eliminated race conditions. |
| Re‑use row pool (no destroy + create): it kept a fixed array of ± BUFFER_ROWS rows, changed their innerHTML and style.top, but never removed them. | The element anchoring the user’s eye (typically the row centered in viewport) kept its DOM identity; its top offset didn’t change when new rows appeared above or below. |
| Constant row height: ROW_HEIGHT was a single variable, updated only when the user touched the font‑size slider. | Every calculation was a simple multiple; scrollTo(index) was always index × ROW_HEIGHT, so links, bookmarks, and “random verse” never landed mid‑row. |

3 One‑screen plan for your engineer
Give the container a guaranteed height

js
Copy
const ROW_HEIGHT = 120;                     // pixel value
container.style.height = (totalVerses * ROW_HEIGHT) + "px";
Do this once after you know how many canonical or chronological keys you have.

Unify scrolling logic
Remove any IntersectionObserver or nested onScroll that tries to add rows.
Keep exactly one scroll listener on the element that actually scrolls.

Early‑exit guard in that listener

js
Copy
if (newStart === currentStart && newEnd === currentEnd) return;
Row recycling instead of rebuild

js
Copy
let pool = [];   // create BUFFER_ROWS*2 rows on first run

for (let i = newStart; i <= newEnd; i++){
  const row = pool[i - newStart];           // reuse
  row.style.top = (i * ROW_HEIGHT) + "px";
  fillRow(row, verseKeys[i]);
}
Anchor preservation after dynamic changes
Whenever you inject a new translation column, or the user toggles label highlighting, do three steps:

js
Copy
const centerPix   = scrollTop + clientHeight/2;
const centerIndex = Math.floor(centerPix / ROW_HEIGHT);

// …perform DOM updates (changing innerHTML only) …

scrollTo(centerIndex * ROW_HEIGHT);   // restore anchor
This guarantees the verse that was in the middle remains in the middle.

4 Quick validation checklist
Start Performance recording → scroll bottom → no frame exceeds 16 ms.

In Elements panel, row count never exceeds ± 150.

Scroll to Psalm 150, copy URL, refresh: you land on Psalm 150 with no jump.

Turn on an extra translation & re‑scroll: memory rises only a few MB.

If any of those fails, re‑check the five‑step plan: placeholder height, single listener, guard, pool, anchor.
