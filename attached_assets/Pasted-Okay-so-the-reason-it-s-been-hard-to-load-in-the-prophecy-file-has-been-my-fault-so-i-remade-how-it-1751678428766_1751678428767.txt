Okay so the reason it's been hard to load in the prophecy file has been my fault, so i remade how it is viewed.

Build script (build_verse_index.py) runs after any change. It produces two machine-friendly files:

https://ecaqvxbbscwcxbjpfrdm.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/anointed/references/prophecy_index.txt
prophecy_index.txt – for each Bible verse, tells you which prophecy IDs mention it and in which role (P/F/V). Format:
Gen.6:3$2:P,2:V

https://ecaqvxbbscwcxbjpfrdm.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/anointed/references/prophecy_rows.json
prophecy_rows.json – one big object keyed by prophecy ID that contains the title + the three verse lists.

These two files are what the browser downloads; prophecy-file.txt never ships to users.

2. How the front-end renders a Bible row

The row factory receives a verse key, say Gen.2:17.

It looks up that key in the in-memory map built from verse-index.txt.
Result: [ { id: 1, role: "P" } ].

For each ID (here, just 1) it pulls the matching record from prophecy_rows.json.

It creates one “prophecy block” across the three prophecy columns:

The header shows 1. Death will become the normal lot of man.

The Prediction cell lists the two prediction verses (Gen 2:17, Gen 3:19).

The Fulfilment and Verification cells list their own verses.

If several prophecies reference the same verse, steps 2-4 repeat and the blocks just stack vertically.

All three cells share the same data-id="1", so a single click on the header collapses/expands that prophecy in every column at once.

3. Why this is bullet-proof

The verse index removes all guesswork—each verse key says exactly which prophecy IDs touch it.

The rows JSON guarantees the UI has the full text for titles and verse lists.

Rendering requires two hash-map look-ups per table row—fast no matter how many prophecies exist.

That’s the entire pipeline—from text file to the exact three-cell layout you see in the screenshot.
