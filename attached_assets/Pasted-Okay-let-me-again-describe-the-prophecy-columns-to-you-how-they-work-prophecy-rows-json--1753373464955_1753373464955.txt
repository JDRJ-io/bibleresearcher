Okay let me again describe the prophecy columns to you & how they work

prophecy_rows.json

{
  "1": {
    "summary": "Death will become the normal lot of man",
    "prophecy": [
      "Gen.2:17",
      "Gen.3:19"
    ],
    "fulfillment": [
      "Rom.5:12"
    ],
    "verification": [
      "Eccl.3:2",
      "Heb.9:27",
      "Jas.1:15",
      "1Cor.15:21",
      "1Cor.15:22"
    ]
  },

prophecy_index.txt

Gen.17:5$8:V,9:V,30:P,541:P
Gen.17:6$30:P,541:P
Gen.17:7$5:V,491:P,492:F
Gen.17:8$7:V,77:P,491:P,654:P
Gen.17:9$491:P
Gen.18:10$11:P
Gen.18:14$11:P,11:V
Gen.18:18$28:P,541:P
Gen.1:28$664:V

here's how we look at this
we can see the 1st prophecy in prophecy_rows.json

Gen.2:17, Gen.3:19 (are both under the column of prophecy meaning prediction) **sorry for some reason prediction column is labelled as prophecy column in the prophecy_rows.json
Rom.5:12 (is under the column of fulfillment)
Eccl.3:2, Heb.9:27, Jas.1:15, 1Cor.15:21, 1Cor.15:22 (are al under the column of verification)
so for each verse

here's what we do to connect this data together
prophecy index is organized alphabetically, not canonically, but it will have a clear mapping to every verse that is associated with prophecy. 
first step is mapping out prophecy_index.txt to every verse reference (connected to to the reference column)
that is associated with prophecy.
so let's take from prophecy_index.txt "Gen.1:28$664:V"
we can see that this verse is associated with prophecy 664, and is a V for verification of that prophecy.
to populate the proper prophecy columns in the Row of Gen.1:28 (as identified by it's row from the reference column)
we look up the prophecy 664 in the prophecy_rows.json

  },
  "664": {
    "summary": "No barrenness or miscarriages, population multiplies",
    "prophecy": [
      "Exod.23:26",
      "Deut.7:14",
      "Deut.28:4",
      "Deut.28:11",
      "Isa.9:3",
      "Lev.26:9"
    ],
    "fulfillment": [
      "Ps.113:9",
      "Isa.54:1"
    ],
    "verification": [
      "Gen.1:28",
      "Gen.30:22",
      "Gen.30:23",
      "1Sam.2:5",
      "Luke.1:36",
      "Luke.1:37",
      "Acts.2:17",
      "Acts.2:18"
    ]
  },

for Gen.1:28 we will put the title of the prophecy "No barrenness or miscarriages, population multiplies" at the beginning of each of the 3 prophecy cells in that row, showing the summarized title of the prophecy
then we will fill each of the prophecy cells with the information in this prophecy
prophecy(prediction) cell for row Gen.1:28 get's these verses (with the same translation text as the main translation being used)
      "Exod.23:26",
      "Deut.7:14",
      "Deut.28:4",
      "Deut.28:11",
      "Isa.9:3",
      "Lev.26:9"

fulfillment cell for row Gen.1:28 gets 
      "Ps.113:9",
      "Isa.54:1"

verification cell for row Gen.1:28 get's 
      "Gen.1:28",
      "Gen.30:22",
      "Gen.30:23",
      "1Sam.2:5",
      "Luke.1:36",
      "Luke.1:37",
      "Acts.2:17",
      "Acts.2:18"

---

now since we use prophecy_index.txt to populate the rows prophetic column cells with the proper information; if we see a row like this;
Gen.18:18$28:P,541:P
that would mean that Gen.18:17 is a prediction(prophecy) for prophecy 28 & a prediction(prophecy) for prophecy 541
we would look up prophecy 28 and fill the prophetic columns cells with the associated verses, and we would then separate the prophecies with a summary title divider of the next prophecy & then place the associated verses in prophecy 541 below that in those cells. 

also since these cells are connected, the prophecy drawers were an old factor that used to allow us to click on a summary of a prophecy in the columns and close the data of all it's verses, so that people could reach the next prophecy faster

i hope this is pretty straigthforward
