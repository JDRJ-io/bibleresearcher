it takes like a second to long to show the cross references, it logs all that it shows in the log it seems like before actually presenting them, can we prioritize presenting them instead of logging them?

there is an error in the cross reference loading function
when it pulls verses if there format is; number $ number
like
$Gen.4:14$1Thess.1:9$

it will take the number after and add it to the number before the $, creating an invalid reference
it kept taking the number after the $ and adding it to the reference before;
making like
Gen.4:141
Thess.1:9

can we make it stop doing that?
i tried to do this before with specific examples, but the system only started recognizing those specific examples and not the actual problem

dont make a whole new file please just fix the right loading
