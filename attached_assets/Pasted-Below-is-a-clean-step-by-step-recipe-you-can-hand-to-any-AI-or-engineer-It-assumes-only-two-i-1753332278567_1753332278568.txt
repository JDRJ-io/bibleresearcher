Below is a **clean, step‑by‑step recipe** you can hand to any AI or engineer.
It assumes only two inputs are available at runtime:

* **`prophecy_rows.json`** – keyed by prophecy ID

  ```json
  {
    "131": {
      "title": "Noah will be a source of comforting preservation",
      "prediction":   ["Gen.5:29"],
      "fulfillment":  ["Gen.6:8", "Gen.7:1"],
      "verification": ["Gen.6:18", "Gen.7:23", "Heb.11:7", "1Pet.3:20"]
    },
    …
  }
  ```
* **`verse‑index.txt`** – keyed by verse, tells which prophecy IDs mention it and in **which column (P/F/V)**

  ```
  1Chr.11:17$131:V
  1Chr.11:18$131:V
  Gen.5:29$131:P
  Gen.7:1$131:F
  ```

## A. Load everything once at start‑up

1. **Fetch** both files.
2. **Parse**:

   * `prophecy_rows.json` → keep as a plain object `const prophecyRows`.
   * `prophecy_index.txt` → build a `Map<verseKey, [{id, role}]>` where
     `role` is always `"P"` (Prediction), `"F"` (Fulfilment) or `"V"` (Verification).

That’s all the data prep you need.

---

## B. Render each Bible row

> “Row” = one verse in the main Bible column + three prophecy columns.

1. **Identify the verse key** for this row (e.g., `1Chr.11:17`).
2. **Lookup** that key in the map from *prophecy_index*.
   *If nothing is found, leave the three prophecy cells empty and you’re done.*
3. **For every returned entry `{id, role}`**:

   1. Pull `const p = prophecyRows[id]`.
   2. Make (or reuse) a single *prophecy block* element that spans the three prophecy columns in this row:

      * **Header** → `id + ". " + p.title`
      * **Prediction body**   → list `p.prediction`
      * **Fulfilment body**  → list `p.fulfillment`
      * **Verification body** → list `p.verification`
   3. While creating the three bodies, decide if this row is the *anchor* for the column:

      * Anchor if `role === "P"` **and** you are filling the Prediction cell, etc.
      * If it is the anchor, add a CSS class like `anchor` to that block so design can style it (soft outline, glow, etc.).
4. If multiple prophecies reference the same verse, repeat step 3; the blocks simply stack vertically inside each prophecy cell.

---

## C. User‑facing polish (CSS, no JS changes)

* `.prophecy-block.anchor` gets the special highlight so readers instantly see “this verse is the Verification for prophecy 131,” etc.
* Long verse references or texts wrap normally, because the `.prophecy-body` div has `white-space: normal; word-break: break-word;`.
* Column headers are static: **Prediction**, **Fulfilment**, **Verification**.

---

### One‑sentence hand‑off

*“At boot we load `prophecy_rows.json` and `prophecy_index.txt`.
For every verse row, we look up that verse in the index, grab the full record(s) from `prophecy_rows`, and drop a prophecy block into the three columns.
We tag the block with `anchor` only in the column that matches P/F/V for that verse so CSS can give it a gentle cue.”*

to explain this more;

we have like 700 prophecies, each having prediction, fulfillment, & verification verses. 
each prophecy category (of the 700) has a title
we connect these with the same format of the reference connections book.chapter:verse
if we have a bible verse thats a prediction; I want to fill the prophecy columns in that same row with all of the corresponding prediction verses, fulfillment verses & verification verses of that prophecy,
we are also going to do the same for fulfillment verses & verification verses
making sure we have them interconnected through the prophecy columns with the same type of hyperlink references as cross reference has.

we're putting a title once over the first verse in each of those prophetic cells, for the summary of the prophecy, then if we have a second prophecy connected to one of those same verses, we have a divider that is also the title of the next prophecy.
