Cross reference file anointed/references/cf1.txt look like this; with markers for proper references to anchor to, them a $ split between cross references, but a # between sequential verses that are grouped together as references. We need to load the proper verse for all of these references shown in the single cell, these are the cells especially that will have a scrollbar in them because the data inside one cell will be very much

Here are the prophecy connections
Anointed/references/prophecy-file.txt

Not every verse will have a connection to prophecy but we want the prophecy links to show up in 4 columns after the cross references. Showing hyperlinks between connections in each prophecy. Columns are split in this between "$" the way this is structured is prophecy number$prediction verses$fulfillment verses$evidence verses$summary
So everywhere there is a bible reference in the prediction slot, we connect that prophecy verse to that specific row in the prediction column, showing hyperlinks to the verses that will connect with that prophecy in the adjacent columns with that
