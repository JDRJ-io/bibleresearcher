Got it — I’ve studied all five screenshots carefully. Let me define what’s happening with your **centering logic** and highlight the nuance you pointed out (alternate translation columns not shifting the centering).

---

## 1. What “Centering” Means Here

When you have only a few columns active inside a wide **landscape viewport**, the system tries to keep the table visually centered instead of hugging the left side. That centering depends on which column types are active and how widths are being calculated.

* **True Centering** = columns are distributed evenly left and right, with the table’s midpoint aligned to the viewport midpoint.
* **Current Behavior** = centering logic is being applied inconsistently, depending on which columns are toggled on.

---

## 2. Behaviors by Case (from your screenshots)

### (A) Notes + KJV only

* The KJV column is left-aligned, but the centering logic tries to push the small set of columns toward the middle.
* You can see some offset but not perfect alignment with the headers.

---

### (B) KJV + Prophecy Columns (Prediction / Fulfillment / Verification)

* As soon as prophecy columns are added, **centering recalculates**.
* The table expands, and the prophecy columns influence both horizontal offset and header alignment.
* This shows prophecy columns are included in the centering system.

---

### (C) KJV + Cross Refs

* With cross-references toggled, the centering logic again adjusts.
* The table body shifts; headers are recalculated.
* Cross refs **do participate** in the centering calculation.

---

### (D) KJV + AMP (alternate translation)

* AMP column is added as an alternate translation.
* **Notice:** The overall centering does **not change at all**.
* Instead, the AMP column simply appends next to KJV with no recalculation of horizontal offset.
* This means alternate translations are **not hooked into the centering logic**.

---

### (E) Reset back to KJV only

* Returns to original behavior (like A).
* Confirms that alternate translations were ignored entirely in the centering logic, since removing them didn’t shift anything.

## 3. Why Alternate Translations Don’t Shift Centering

Based on your system design (from our earlier dives):

* Prophecy, Notes, Cross Refs = handled as **special, independent column groups** inside your centering function.
* Alternate Translations = being treated as an **extension of the main translation group**, rather than new columns that affect table width.
* Because of that, when calculating centering offset, the logic only checks the “main translation width” variable, not the number of alternates.

So visually, you’re seeing:

* **Prophecy / Cross Refs / Notes** → *affect centering*
* **Alternate Translations** → *ignored by centering system*

## 4. What’s Actually Happening in Code (likely)

From the hierarchy you shared earlier:

* `useAdaptivePortraitColumns` and `useResponsiveColumns` define widths.
* But **only the main translation width (`--adaptive-main-width`)** is factored into centering.
* Alternate translations share the same CSS variable bucket and are rendered as additional grid items — but without triggering a recalculation in the centering logic.

---

✅ **Definition Summary**:

* Current centering system is **aware of Notes, Cross Refs, and Prophecy columns**.
* It is **not aware of alternate translations** — they append to the table without updating the offset logic.
* This is why adding AMP beside KJV doesn’t shift the table’s center the way prophecy/cross-refs do.

Would you like me to write out for your AI engineer **the exact patch goal** — i.e., how to update the centering logic so alternate translations contribute to the horizontal offset calculation the same way prophecy/cross-ref columns do?
