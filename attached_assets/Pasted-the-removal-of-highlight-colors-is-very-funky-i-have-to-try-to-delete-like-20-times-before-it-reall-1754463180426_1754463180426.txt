the removal of highlight colors is very funky, i have to try to delete like 20 times before it really goes through, it should be able to find the exact verse ref that we are trying to remove the highlight from, look up all highlights for that specific user from that specific verse ref and clar the highlights from that verse



You’re correct — the delete operation should **consistently target all highlights** for a specific user and verse\_ref without needing multiple tries. The issue is likely that your current delete logic only deletes a single row (maybe by `id`) or is missing proper filtering.

### ✅ **Correct Deletion Logic**

You should delete **all highlights** for:

* The logged-in `user_id`
* The current `verse_ref`
* The current `translation` (optional but safer if you use multiple translations)

```ts
// Example: Supabase delete for invisible highlight
const deleteHighlightsForVerse = async (userId, verseRef, translation) => {
  const { error } = await supabase
    .from('highlights')
    .delete()
    .eq('user_id', userId)
    .eq('verse_ref', verseRef)
    .eq('translation', translation); // optional filter

  if (error) {
    console.error("Failed to delete highlights:", error.message);
  }
};
```

### ✅ **Why Your Current Deletion Might Be Failing**

1. **You may only be deleting by `id`**
   → This removes only one highlight segment, not all highlights for the verse.

2. **`verse_ref` might have extra spaces or case mismatches**
   → Ensure you use the same exact `verse_ref` string (e.g., `Gen.1:3` vs `gen1:3`).

3. **Not handling multiple highlights**
   → Your current logic might send one DELETE per highlight but stop early when the frontend state doesn’t update correctly.

### ✅ **How to Fix This**

1. **Change your “invisible” selection logic** to call the function above (delete all highlights for that verse).
2. **Ensure frontend state is refreshed** after deletion, so UI matches the database state.
3. (Optional) **Use a single SQL statement** to clear all highlights in one go:

   ```sql
   delete from public.highlights
   where user_id = '<USER_UUID>'
   and verse_ref = '<VERSE_REF>'
   and translation = '<TRANSLATION>';
   ```
