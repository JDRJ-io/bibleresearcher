### Quick verdict

Both AI notes **diagnose the same root-cause correctly**:

> *`useMyProfile` runs **inside** `AuthProvider` before the
> context is ready, so it always receives `user =null` & `loading =true`
> and bails out → endless spinner.*

Either proposal (they’re practically identical) will break the circular
dependency and let the profile query run.
You only need **one** of them.

## What will actually fix the loop (5-minute refactor)

| Step                                                                                                           | Why                                                        | Code snippet                                                                                                                                                                                 |   |                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | - | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Pass user into the hook instead of calling `useAuth()` inside it**                                        | Removes the self-reference that blocks.                    | `ts // hooks/useMyProfile.ts export function useMyProfile(user: User \| null, authLoading: boolean) { /* delete useAuth(); keep the rest */ }`                                               |   |                                                                 |
| **2. Call the hook *after* the context has user**                                                              | Ensures hook runs with real `user` & `authLoading=false`.  | \`\`\`tsx // contexts/AuthContext.tsx const { profile, profileLoading, error, save } = useMyProfile(user, loading); return ( \<AuthContext.Provider value={{ user, session, loading: loading |   | profileLoading, profile, saveProfile: save, signOut }}> …\`\`\` |
| **3. Remove the old stub values** (`profile:null`, `refreshProfile`, `updateProfile`) from the provider value. | So components get live data, not ❌ `null`.                 | *(delete those props)*                                                                                                                                                                       |   |                                                                 |
| **4. Keep the trigger + RLS policy** you already added.                                                        | Guarantees every user has a row and permission to read it. | *(no change needed)*                                                                                                                                                                         |   |                                                                 |

That’s it.  No other component rewiring is required; any place that already
does:

```ts
const { user, profile } = useAuth();
```

will now get a real `profile` object once the hook resolves.

### Why this ends the 4-hour loop

* **No more duplicate loaders.** One hook, one context.
* **No more hanging auth call.** We reuse the `user` that `AuthProvider`
  fetched.
* **No more missing row / 42501.** Trigger and policy already cover that.

After these edits:

1. Reload → Console shows

   ```
   HOOK FILE LOADED
   EFFECT TRIGGERED  { hasUser:true }
   PROFILE ↩️ { name:null, bio:null, tier:'free' } null
   ```
2. Spinner disappears; form fields populate.
3. “Save Changes” persists and reflects in the header dropdown.
4. Redeeming `DEV-ALPHA-2025` flips tier to **premium** and UI updates.

Apply those four edits and you’re out of the loop. If something still stalls,
paste the exact console error or SQL message and we can target that single
remaining issue.
