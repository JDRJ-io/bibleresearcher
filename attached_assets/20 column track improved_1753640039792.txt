Responsive 20-Column Layout With Resizing and Rearranging

Designing a 20-Column Adaptive Layout System in React
Implementing a flexible 20-column layout with drag-and-drop reordering, resizable columns, global scaling, sticky headers/columns, and responsive behavior is a complex task. It involves coordinating state management, UI libraries for interactivity, and careful use of CSS for alignment and responsiveness. This report breaks down a recommended strategy with libraries, state structures, and implementation patterns for each requirement.
1. Overview of Requirements and Challenges
Before diving into specifics, let's summarize the key features we need to support and the challenges involved:
20-Column Layout with Sticky Elements: We have a wide table-like layout (20 columns). One column is a sticky reference column (fixed to the side), and the header row is sticky at the top. This requires keeping those sticky elements aligned with the scrollable content.
Drag-and-Drop Reordering: Users should be able to drag columns (including the sticky column) to rearrange their order. This must be intuitive and not interfere with column resizing.
Resizable Columns: Each column’s width should be adjustable via a drag handle (edge dragging). Resizing should update the layout in real-time and keep headers aligned with content.
Global Scaling Slider: A slider control should adjust all column widths and text sizes simultaneously (a global zoom or scale). The column widths and text should enlarge or shrink in unison based on this slider.
Unlock Mode Toggle: The UI should have a mode (e.g., “Edit Layout” toggle) that when enabled, allows the drag-and-drop and resize interactions. When “locked”, these interactions are disabled (to prevent accidental layout changes).
Reset to Default: A reset button should revert the layout to the default configuration (column order, visibility, and sizing) defined for guest users. Logged-out (guest) users always see the default on each visit, whereas logged-in users can have saved preferences.
Responsive Adaptation: The layout should adapt to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) with precision. This may involve adjusting column widths, hiding certain columns, or altering the global scale automatically. It also means ensuring the table can scroll horizontally on small screens if needed.
Persistent User Preferences: For logged-in users, remember their customized layout on a per-device basis. Each device can have its own saved layout (so a user’s desktop layout doesn’t override their mobile layout). Guest users do not have persistent layout (always default or session-only).
With these in mind, we’ll explore solutions for each aspect. We will use Zustand for state management and consider libraries like @dnd-kit or react-dnd for drag-and-drop, react-resizable for resizing, and a slider component (like rc-slider or a UI framework slider) for the global scale control.
2. Drag-and-Drop Column Reordering
Recommended Libraries: For modern React applications (React 18+), a good choice is @dnd-kit for drag-and-drop. It’s actively maintained and works well with table layouts
tanstack.com
. While react-dnd was historically popular, it’s less maintained and can have issues in React 18 Strict Mode
tanstack.com
. Another option is react-beautiful-dnd, which provides high-level drag-and-drop for lists, but it has a large bundle size and its maintenance status is uncertain
tanstack.com
. Given these, @dnd-kit is a robust choice. It provides flexible primitives to handle dragging, and even has examples for sortable lists (which we can adapt for columns). Implementation Approach: Treat the table header cells as draggable items. In “unlock” mode, each column header becomes a drag handle that users can grab to reorder that column.
Using @dnd-kit: You would wrap your table in a <DndContext> and use sortable sensors. Each column header could use useSortable({ id: columnId }) to make it draggable and droppable in a new position. The library will provide events like onDragEnd where you can handle reordering logic by updating the column order state. @dnd-kit requires managing the state of item order manually, which fits well with our Zustand store (we’ll maintain an order: string[] representing column IDs in current order).
Alternate (react-dnd or native): If using react-dnd, you’d define a drag source on the header and a drop target on other headers to swap positions. However, @dnd-kit’s abstractions (like <SortableContext> with a list of item ids) simplify a lot of this. Native HTML5 Drag events are another option; libraries like Material React Table V2 have implemented column DnD with just onDragStart/End/Enter events
tanstack.com
, but handling all edge cases (especially touch) can be tricky.
Sticky Column Consideration: The sticky first column should also be draggable like any other column. If the first column is moved to another position, it may lose its “sticky” status (and a new first column might become sticky). One approach is to always treat the left-most column as sticky via CSS; if columns reorder, whichever column ends up in the first position gets the sticky styling. This can be handled by dynamic classing (e.g., the column with index 0 in order gets a sticky-col class). Drag Preview and Performance: When dragging column headers, especially if using a library like @dnd-kit, ensure that the drag “preview” is styled appropriately (often the library will clone the element). Also, moving columns will involve reordering the DOM or adjusting a state that influences rendering of the columns in new order. Keep the row rendering efficient (virtualization could be considered if huge data, but that’s beyond scope here). The drag library should handle most pointer events logic; our focus is to update state and re-render columns in the new order. Updating State on Drop: On drop (drag end), compute the new order of column IDs. For example, if using @dnd-kit’s sortable, you get the new index of the dragged item. Update the Zustand state order array accordingly. The table will re-render columns in the new order by mapping over this order. Here’s a simplified example using a reorder helper:
jsx
Copy
// Pseudo-code for handling drop with @dnd-kit
const handleDragEnd = (event) => {
  const { active, over } = event;
  if (!over || active.id === over.id) return;
  setColumnOrder((prevOrder) => {
    const oldIndex = prevOrder.indexOf(active.id);
    const newIndex = prevOrder.indexOf(over.id);
    const newOrder = [...prevOrder];
    // Remove item from oldIndex and insert at newIndex
    const [moved] = newOrder.splice(oldIndex, 1);
    newOrder.splice(newIndex, 0, moved);
    return newOrder;
  });
};
This will rearrange the order state array. The UI should then reflect the new column sequence.
3. Column Resizing by Dragging
Recommended Library: react-resizable is a lightweight library to make components resizable via handles
github.com
. It provides a <Resizable> component that you wrap around an element, and it injects drag handles on specified edges. We can wrap each column header cell (or content cell) with <Resizable> to enable horizontal resizing from the right edge.
Usage: Using <Resizable> directly gives you callbacks like onResize with the new width and height
github.com
. We would use only horizontal resizing (e.g., handle on the East edge) for columns. The component expects you to manage the state of the width (and height, but height can remain constant for our rows) yourself. In practice, you maintain a width state per column in the store, and pass width={column.width} to the Resizable, and update on onResize.
Integration with Table: When a column is resized, we want the header and all cells of that column to reflect the new width. If using a semantic <table>, an effective approach is to use a <colgroup> with <col> elements for each column. By setting the width style on the <col> elements, the browser will apply that width to the entire column, ensuring header and body cells align automatically. In React, we can render a <colgroup> based on our state:
jsx
Copy
<table style={{ tableLayout: 'fixed' }}>
  <colgroup>
    {columnsState.map(col => (
      <col key={col.id} style={{ width: col.width * globalScale }} />
    ))}
  </colgroup>
  <thead> ... </thead>
  <tbody> ... </tbody>
</table>
Here, col.width might be stored in absolute pixels (and we multiply by a globalScale factor – more on that later). Using tableLayout: fixed ensures the table respects the explicit widths and doesn’t auto-resize based on content.
Applying Resizable: We can wrap the content of each header cell with a <Resizable> handle on the right side. For example, using react-resizable:
jsx
Copy
import { Resizable } from 'react-resizable';
// ...
<Resizable 
  width={col.width} height={0} 
  handle={<span className="resize-handle" />} 
  onResize={(e, data) => setColumnWidth(col.id, data.size.width)}
  draggableOpts={{ enableUserSelectHack: false }}
>
  <div style={{ width: col.width }}>
    {col.label /* header text */}
  </div>
</Resizable>
In this snippet, setColumnWidth would update our Zustand state for that column’s width. The handle is a custom element (like a span or icon) for the drag handle; .resize-handle can be styled as a small gripper at the right edge. We only care about width (so height is not managed, we set it to 0 or a fixed value). The draggableOpts with enableUserSelectHack: false is often used to prevent text selection issues while dragging.
State Updates: As the user drags, onResize fires continuously with updated size. We update the store state (which causes re-render). Because we’re using a table with fixed layout and colgroup, the header and body will automatically adjust. If not using a table, you’d have to ensure both the header cell component and all row cell components for that column get the updated width (which could mean context or direct state mapping for width). The colgroup method is simpler for alignment.
Min/Max Constraints: You can set minWidth and maxWidth on each Resizable (via minConstraints/maxConstraints in react-resizable’s ResizableBox, or manually enforcing in onResize callback). This prevents columns from becoming too narrow or too wide. For instance, minWidth might be something like 50px to ensure usability.
Combining Resize + Reorder: One challenge is that the drag to resize might conflict with drag to reorder if a user drags near the edges. To mitigate this, use distinct UI elements/regions for each action. For example, make the header text area draggable for reordering, but the small handle icon at the edge for resizing. This separation ensures that when the user grabs the edge, the resize logic is triggered, and when they grab the center of header, the reorder logic is triggered. (Libraries like react-beautiful-dnd also allow setting shouldRespectMouseTarget or using handle props to limit draggable area.)
4. Global Width & Text Scaling via Slider
In addition to per-column resizing, the system needs a global slider that scales all column widths and text size together. This acts like a zoom or density control, letting the user expand or condense the entire table layout easily. Slider Component: A simple solution is to use a range input or a React slider library. For a polished UI, rc-slider is a popular choice, providing a configurable slider component
npmjs.com
. Alternatively, the Slider from Material-UI (MUI) or Chakra UI could be used if those UI frameworks are in play. The slider should output a numeric value (e.g., 0.5 to 2.0) representing a global scale factor (1.0 = default size). Linking to Column Widths and Text: The global scale can be applied in a few ways:
State Multiplier: Keep a globalScale value in Zustand (default 1.0). When rendering column widths, multiply each base width by this factor. If using the <colgroup> approach, you might store each column’s base width, and compute col.width * globalScale in the JSX or via a derived state selector. For text scaling, you could apply a CSS transform or simply use relative font sizes (like font-size: 1rem * globalScale). A straightforward way is to attach a CSS class or style on the table container that scales font-size. Example:
css
Copy
.table-container.scaled {
  --scale: 1.2;
  font-size: calc(16px * var(--scale));
}
.table-container.scaled th, .table-container.scaled td {
  /* If needed, adjust padding/margins using the same scale */
}
Then dynamically set --scale in inline styles or via a CSS-in-JS when globalScale changes.
CSS Zoom/Transform: Using CSS zoom or a transform: scale() on the entire table could scale everything, but that can cause issues with positioning of sticky elements and might not precisely reflect desired width adjustments. It’s safer to manually adjust font-size and column widths via state as described.
Slider Behavior: The slider’s onChange handler should update the Zustand state for globalScale. For example:
jsx
Copy
<Slider min={0.5} max={2} step={0.1} value={globalScale} onChange={(val) => setGlobalScale(val)} />
This will cause a re-render with new widths and font sizes. You might also throttle/debounce the updates to avoid too many renders if performance is an issue, but since it’s just 20 columns, real-time update is fine. Text Overflow: When scaling down, text might overflow narrower columns. Ensure that cells either wrap text or show ellipsis as needed (CSS white-space: nowrap; text-overflow: ellipsis; overflow: hidden; on cell contents is common). When scaling up, the table might overflow the viewport horizontally; users can scroll or reduce scale as needed – that’s expected.
5. Unlock Mode Toggle and UI States
The interface should provide an "Unlock layout" toggle (e.g., a button or switch). When unlock mode is enabled:
Drag-and-drop handles for columns are active (the user can grab and move columns).
Resize handles on column edges are visible and active.
The global slider (if present in UI) could be enabled as well (though slider might always be available even in locked mode for convenience, depending on requirements).
When locked:
Dragging columns does nothing (could be disabled by not rendering the DnD context or by a conditional that only attaches drag handlers if unlocked).
Resize handles are hidden or non-functional.
The slider might be disabled or could remain active if considered separate from layout editing (scaling might still be allowed even if columns can’t be rearranged, depending on design).
Implementation:
Add an unlocked (boolean) state in Zustand to track the mode.
Condition the rendering of interactive elements on this state. For example, only wrap headers in <Resizable> and add useSortable if unlocked === true.
The drag/drop library context can perhaps always be present, but the handle can be conditionally active. With @dnd-kit, you can dynamically enable/disable sorting strategy or simply not allow drag if locked. With react-dnd, you might not collect drag sources if locked.
Visual Cues: Change the cursor or highlight when unlocked. For instance, add a class like .editing on the container when unlocked to show resize grippers and maybe a different cursor on header hover. When locked, these are hidden. This ensures users don’t accidentally try to drag when it’s locked. Keyboard Accessibility: If needed, ensure that unlock mode’s features are also accessible (e.g., maybe allow arrow keys to move columns when unlocked, etc., but that may be beyond scope).
6. State Management with Zustand
Using Zustand for this scenario is sensible due to its simplicity and flexibility. We need to store and update:
Column Order: The sequence of column IDs in the current layout.
Column Properties: At least width and visibility per column, possibly also an identifier and default order index. We can store an array of column objects or separate pieces of state.
Global Scale: The slider value for scaling.
Unlock Mode: Boolean for whether layout editing is enabled.
Defaults & Persistence: The default layout configuration (for resets and for guests), and possibly persistence for user preferences.
A possible shape for the Zustand store:
js
Copy
import create from 'zustand';
import { persist } from 'zustand/middleware';

const defaultColumns = [
  { id: 'col1', label: 'Column 1', width: 150, visible: true },
  { id: 'col2', label: 'Column 2', width: 120, visible: true },
  // ... up to col20 with default widths
];
const defaultOrder = defaultColumns.map(col => col.id);

const useLayoutStore = create(
  persist(
    (set, get) => ({
      columns: defaultColumns,       // array of column objects (or use a map by id)
      order: defaultOrder,           // array of column IDs in current order
      globalScale: 1,                // default scale 1x
      unlocked: false,               // layout editing locked by default
      // Action: toggle unlock mode
      toggleUnlocked: () => set(state => ({ unlocked: !state.unlocked })),
      // Action: set a specific column's width
      setColumnWidth: (id, newWidth) => set(state => ({
        columns: state.columns.map(col => col.id === id ? { ...col, width: newWidth } : col)
      })),
      // Action: move a column in the order array
      moveColumn: (sourceId, targetId) => set(state => {
        const idxFrom = state.order.indexOf(sourceId);
        const idxTo = state.order.indexOf(targetId);
        if (idxFrom === -1 || idxTo === -1) return {};
        const newOrder = [...state.order];
        const [moved] = newOrder.splice(idxFrom, 1);
        newOrder.splice(idxTo, 0, moved);
        return { order: newOrder };
      }),
      // Action: set visibility (toggle hide/show column)
      toggleColumnVisibility: (id) => set(state => ({
        columns: state.columns.map(col => col.id === id ? { ...col, visible: !col.visible } : col)
      })),
      // Action: set global scale
      setGlobalScale: (scale) => set({ globalScale: scale }),
      // Action: reset to default layout
      resetLayout: () => set({
        columns: defaultColumns,
        order: defaultOrder,
        globalScale: 1,
      })
    }),
    {
      name: 'column-layout', // localStorage key for persistence
      partialize: (state) => ({
        columns: state.columns,
        order: state.order,
        globalScale: state.globalScale
      })
      // We persist only the essential parts (not persisting 'unlocked' state or others).
    }
  )
);
Let’s break down some points from the above structure:
We wrap our store with persist middleware. By default, Zustand’s persist uses localStorage to store the state
github.com
. The name: 'column-layout' is the storage key. We use partialize to specify what to save (columns, order, globalScale), leaving out ephemeral UI state like unlocked or anything else we don’t want to persist.
Device-Based Persistence: Because localStorage is specific to the device/browser, using persist already achieves “device-based memory” for a logged-in user. We might, however, want separate keys for different users. One strategy is to include the user ID in the storage key, e.g., name: user ? 'column-layout-' + user.id : 'column-layout-guest'. If no user (guest), we could either not persist at all or use a guest key that we clear often. In practice, since we want guests to always start fresh, we might simply not use persistence for guests. This could be done by conditionally applying the middleware after login, or by ignoring any saved guest state on load (always calling resetLayout if not logged in).
columns vs order: We keep both an array of column objects and a separate order array of ids. We could derive one from the other, but keeping order explicitly makes reordering easier (we don’t have to reorder the whole columns array, just map using order for rendering). The columns array here is kept in default order but note, we should probably update it when reordering for persistence consistency. Alternatively, we could store a dictionary of column info by id and rely on the order array to dictate layout.
Visibility: We included a toggle for column visibility. If a column is hidden (visible: false), we should ensure the rendering logic skips it (and maybe the slider or any global operations skip it). For simplicity, one can filter columns by visible when rendering, or maintain a separate list of hidden columns. The reset function would restore all to visible as per defaults.
Persisting User Preferences: For logged-in users, we want to save their layout. We could integrate this with backend by syncing the Zustand state to an API, but a simpler approach is to rely on persist + localStorage for each device. The AG Grid team, for instance, suggests saving grid state in the user profile and loading it on app open
blog.ag-grid.com
. In our case, using localStorage with different keys per user can serve a similar purpose (the “profile” storage is the browser’s local storage). Each time the component mounts for a logged-in user, we load their saved state (Zustand will do this automatically via persist middleware hydration). For guests, to ensure a fresh default each session, do not persist or always call resetLayout when the app initializes if !user. Essentially, treat the persisted data as valid only when a user is logged in. This keeps guest layout decoupled – guests always see the app’s default layout unless they change something in the current session, and even then a page reload could reset it. Example – Using the Store in Components:
In a React component, you might use the store like:
jsx
Copy
const columns = useLayoutStore(state => state.columns);
const order = useLayoutStore(state => state.order);
const globalScale = useLayoutStore(state => state.globalScale);
const unlocked = useLayoutStore(state => state.unlocked);
const setColumnWidth = useLayoutStore(state => state.setColumnWidth);
...
You’d map through order to render columns in the correct sequence, find each column’s data from columns by id, and apply width and visibility accordingly.
7. Maintaining Header-Row Alignment and Sticky Elements
Ensuring the header cells align with their respective column cells in the body is crucial, especially after users resize columns. Two main patterns can achieve this:
Using <table> with <colgroup>: As mentioned, an HTML table inherently keeps columns aligned, and using a <colgroup> to set widths ensures both header (<th>) and body (<td>) use those widths. This is a straightforward approach and works well with position: sticky for header/columns. Just ensure the table has table-layout: fixed and a defined width or max-width to allow horizontal scrolling for overflow.
Using CSS Grid Layout: Another approach is to use a CSS grid container for the table. You can define a grid with 20 columns and many rows. Each “row” (header and each data row) is a grid row using the same grid template. For example:
jsx
Copy
<div className="table-grid">
  <div className="header-row">
    {columns.map(col => <div className="cell header-cell">{col.label}</div>)}
  </div>
  {data.map(row => (
    <div className="body-row" key={row.id}>
      {columns.map(col => <div className="cell">{row[col.id]}</div>)}
    </div>
  ))}
</div>
And CSS:
css
Copy
.table-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 150px 120px 200px ...; /* 20 values or use repeat() */
  overflow: auto;
}
.header-row, .body-row {
  display: contents; /* allows the grid children to use the parent's grid definition */
}
.header-cell {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  background: #f0f0f0;
  z-index: 1;
}
.cell { /* general cell styling */ }
With this setup, the grid’s grid-template-columns can be dynamically generated from state (including globalScale). Changing a column width means updating that CSS property. However, updating CSS grid template from React state can be slightly cumbersome (you might use inline style or a styled component that consumes the state). The <colgroup> in a <table> is a bit simpler, but grid offers more control if needed (like reordering columns just by reordering elements, though we have state for that anyway).
Sticky Header: We want the header to stay at the top when scrolling vertically. With a <table> inside a scrollable container, we can make the <thead> row or <th> elements position: sticky; top: 0; in CSS
muhimasri.com
. Make sure to give them a background and a higher z-index than body cells, so that the content scrolling under doesn’t bleed through. For example:
css
Copy
thead th {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  z-index: 1;
  background: #fafafa; /* or use table background color */
}
If not using a table, but e.g. separate header component, you could position it absolutely at top and sync scroll, but CSS sticky is easier and keeps them synchronized automatically (since they share the same scroll container). Sticky First Column: For the first column to stick to the left on horizontal scroll, use position: sticky; left: 0; on all first-column cells (both header and body)
muhimasri.com
. Similar to header, assign a background and a z-index higher than other cells so that it overlays cells scrolled underneath it:
css
Copy
/* assuming first column has a class .sticky-col on each cell */
.sticky-col {
  position: sticky;
  left: 0;
  z-index: 2;
  background: #fafafa;
}
If multiple columns can be pinned or sticky, each subsequent sticky column would use left: [width of all left-sticky columns before it]. For example, if two columns are sticky, first uses left: 0 and second uses left: <width of first>
muhimasri.com
muhimasri.com
. But our case only mentions one reference column sticky. Header-Body Horizontal Sync: By using one scroll container, the browser ensures that horizontal scrolling moves both header and body together. So a <div style="overflow:auto"> wrapping the table will have one scrollbar controlling both. The sticky header and column will remain in place while other cells move. If instead you had separated the header into its own scrollable container, you’d have to listen to scroll events and manually scroll the header to match (to avoid double scrollbars). But using CSS sticky avoids that complexity. Scrollbars and Width Calculations: One detail: If using a fixed header with its own container, the presence of a scrollbar in the body container can offset widths. With a single container and sticky elements, this isn’t an issue. However, if you notice the last column header not aligning due to scrollbar, one trick used is to add padding or a dummy column to accommodate scrollbar width
github.com
. With our approach, it shouldn’t be needed as long as the container is the <div> around the table (the table will naturally take up width). Example Markup with Alignment:
jsx
Copy
<div className="table-container" style={{ overflow: 'auto' }}>
  <table style={{ tableLayout: 'fixed', width: '100%' }}>
    <colgroup>
      {order.map(colId => {
        const col = columns.find(c => c.id === colId);
        return col.visible ? (
          <col key={colId} style={{ width: col.width * globalScale }} />
        ) : null;
      })}
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        {order.map(colId => {
          const col = columns.find(c => c.id === colId);
          if (!col.visible) return null;
          const stickyClass = colId === order[0] ? 'sticky-col' : '';
          return (
            <th key={colId} className={stickyClass}>
              {/* Wrap content with Resizable if unlocked */}
              {unlocked ? 
                <Resizable width={col.width} height={0} onResize={(e, data) => setColumnWidth(colId, data.size.width)}>
                  <div style={{ width: col.width }}>{col.label}</div>
                </Resizable>
               : col.label}
            </th>
          );
        })}
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      {data.map(row => (
        <tr key={row.id}>
          {order.map(colId => {
            const col = columns.find(c => c.id === colId);
            if (!col.visible) return null;
            const stickyClass = colId === order[0] ? 'sticky-col' : '';
            return (
              <td key={colId} className={stickyClass}>
                {row[colId]}
              </td>
            );
          })}
        </tr>
      ))}
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
In this code, the sticky class is applied to the first column’s cells. The widths come from the colgroup. The Resizable is applied only when unlocked. This pattern ensures headers and cells line up because they share the same col definitions.
8. Responsive Adaptation to Screen Size
Adapting a 20-column layout for different screens is challenging – on a narrow mobile screen you will likely have horizontal scrolling. The goals should be to maintain usability by possibly scaling down or hiding less critical columns and ensuring the table isn’t unusably wide. CSS Media Queries: The simplest approach is to use CSS breakpoints to adjust some styles:
At smaller widths, you might reduce the globalScale automatically or set a different base width for columns. For example, use a CSS variable for base column width and override it in a @media query.
You could hide certain columns by default on very small screens (e.g., have a property col.priority and hide those with lowest priority when width < X). If so, your state’s visibility or order could be initialized differently for mobile.
Using the Global Scale for Responsiveness: A clever trick is to tie the responsive behavior to the global scale slider. For instance, on a phone you might default globalScale to 0.8 (making everything 20% smaller), whereas on desktop maybe 1.0 or larger. You can detect initial screen size and set an initial scale accordingly (but still allow the user to change it via slider). This provides an automatic scaling down on mobile without hiding content. However, 20 columns even at 0.5 scale will likely overflow a mobile screen, so horizontal scroll will still occur. ResizeObserver or Layout Effect: For more dynamic adaptation (especially if the app can be resized, e.g., browser window changes or device rotation), a ResizeObserver can watch the container or window width and run logic to adjust the layout. For example, use useLayoutEffect with a ResizeObserver on the table’s container:
jsx
Copy
const containerRef = useRef();
useLayoutEffect(() => {
  if (!containerRef.current) return;
  const observer = new ResizeObserver(entries => {
    for (let entry of entries) {
      const width = entry.contentRect.width;
      if (width < 600) {
        setGlobalScale(0.8);
        // optionally hide certain columns: e.g., if mobile, hide columns beyond a certain index
      } else if (width < 400) {
        setGlobalScale(0.6);
      } else {
        setGlobalScale(1);
      }
    }
  });
  observer.observe(containerRef.current);
  return () => observer.disconnect();
}, []);
This pseudo-code illustrates using ResizeObserver to categorize the container width and adjust globalScale or other state accordingly (similar to how one might change layout for cards as width shrinks
blog.logrocket.com
). You can have multiple thresholds for tablet vs phone. Using useLayoutEffect ensures the DOM measurements are considered before painting, which can help avoid flicker. The LogRocket example demonstrates categorizing sizes (small/medium/large) with a ResizeObserver inside a layout effect
blog.logrocket.com
, which is analogous to what we might do for column layout at various breakpoints. CSS Variables Approach: Another method is to define column widths using CSS variables and update those variables via JS or CSS media:
Define each column’s default width as a CSS variable (or at least define a base unit).
For example: --col1-width: 150px; --col2-width: 120px; ... on :root or a container.
Then your colgroup or grid template columns can use width: var(--col1-width). For global scaling, you could also have a --scale variable that multiplies those (CSS calc can multiply pixel values by a number if the number is itself in a var, though might require each width to be expressed via calc).
On different breakpoints in CSS, you override the variables. E.g.:
css
Copy
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  :root {
    --col1-width: 120px;
    --col2-width: 100px;
    /* smaller defaults for mobile */
    --global-scale: 0.8;
  }
}
And ensure your component reads --global-scale for the scale (or you sync it with the Zustand state on load).
This approach offloads some logic to CSS, but integrating with our interactive resizing can get complicated (since resizing by user is via JS state primarily).
Precision in Responsive Behavior: The phrase "with precision" suggests you want deterministic control over how the layout adapts. This likely means not relying solely on auto-scaling everything fluidly, but setting concrete rules (like breakpoints or explicit adjustments). Using a combination of CSS media queries for broad changes and fine-tuning with JS (ResizeObserver for more granular or container-specific changes) can achieve this. For example:
You might decide that below 768px (tablet), the layout switches to a different mode (maybe columns stack? But stacking 20 columns vertically per row might not be feasible to read). More likely, you keep horizontal scroll but reduce font and padding.
Ensure any fixed dimensions (like if you had a fixed first column width) also shrink appropriately. Maybe the first sticky column is narrower on mobile, etc.
In summary, use media queries to adjust styling (like smaller padding, maybe smaller font base), and use the global scale or hide columns to manage the content width. Also ensure the table container itself can scroll horizontally on small screens (CSS overflow-x: auto on the container).
9. Reset to Default Layout Logic
A “Reset” button should restore the layout to the default state for that user context:
For Guests: Always reset to the application’s default column setup (the one defined in code as default). Because we don’t persist guest changes, a refresh or revisit already naturally shows default. But if a guest messed up the layout in the current session and wants to undo all changes, calling the resetLayout() action from the store will set the columns, order, visibility, and scale back to defaults.
For Logged-in Users: The meaning of “default” could be a bit nuanced. It could mean the default app settings (like a factory reset, discarding their saved prefs), or perhaps the user’s own saved default (if they have a personalized default saved). Typically, it would mean factory defaults. So for a logged-in user, pressing reset might also clear their persisted preference in localStorage (so that on next load, they don’t get the old custom state again). If using Zustand’s persist, one way is to call the resetLayout action and then use the storage.removeItem('column-layout-<user>') to clear persisted data, or rely on the next save to overwrite it.
Implementing Reset: In the Zustand store snippet above, resetLayout sets the state back to defaultColumns, defaultOrder, and globalScale:1. One must be careful that defaultColumns (array of objects) might be referenced by value – to truly reset, you might clone the default structure to avoid accidental mutation. But since we defined it outside as a constant, reusing it is fine as long as we don't mutate it elsewhere. On reset, also set all columns visible: true (or whatever the guest default visibility is – perhaps some columns are hidden by default if desired). Basically, ensure the state matches the initial guest view. If we included persist, after calling reset, the new state will be saved to localStorage for that user. If we want to also clear it entirely, we might do an explicit clear. However, often just updating it to defaults is enough (since that is effectively the default now stored). Decoupling Guest vs Account Layout: It’s important that a guest’s actions do not inadvertently carry over when they log in or vice versa. By using separate storage keys per user and not persisting guest state, we isolate these. For example:
If a user is not logged in, do not load any persisted config (always start from default).
Once they log in, you could load their saved config (if it exists) from localStorage or an API. This might involve a one-time effect on login event: useLayoutStore.getState().resetLayout(); useLayoutStore.persist.rehydrate()... if using Zustand persist.
Alternatively, always keep the store persisted but under 'guest' key for guest sessions and clear it. A simpler path: just not using persist when user is null. Zustand persist could be conditionally applied based on an environment variable, but not straightforward. Instead, you might manage persistence manually: use useEffect to load from localStorage on mount if user is present, and subscribe to state changes to save to localStorage (skipping if not user). That gives full control.
The key best practice is never to mix the default/guest layout with user-specific layout:
Keep a copy of the pristine default config (like our defaultColumns constant) to reset to.
If using localStorage for user, use a separate key per user so one user’s preferences don’t override another’s on the same browser (especially relevant if multiple logins on same machine).
When user logs out, you might want to wipe any transient state and call resetLayout so they see guest default again.
Reset UI: Hook up a button in the UI that calls the resetLayout action. Possibly confirm with the user if they have many changes. When clicked, it should also maybe flip unlocked mode off (so that after reset, they are in normal view mode with default layout).
10. Sample Implementation Patterns
To solidify the above, here are a few focused examples for key pieces of functionality:
a. Zustand State and Persistence Example
js
Copy
// Zustand store for column layout (simplified)
const useLayoutStore = create(
  persist(
    (set, get) => ({
      columns: defaultColumns,
      order: defaultColumns.map(c => c.id),
      globalScale: 1,
      unlocked: false,
      // Actions
      toggleUnlocked: () => set(state => ({ unlocked: !state.unlocked })),
      setGlobalScale: (scale) => set({ globalScale: scale }),
      setColumnWidth: (id, width) => set(state => ({
        columns: state.columns.map(col => col.id === id ? { ...col, width } : col)
      })),
      moveColumn: (sourceId, targetId) => set(state => {
        const order = [...state.order];
        const from = order.indexOf(sourceId);
        const to = order.indexOf(targetId);
        if (from < 0 || to < 0) return {};
        order.splice(to, 0, ...order.splice(from, 1));
        return { order };
      }),
      toggleColumnVisibility: (id) => set(state => ({
        columns: state.columns.map(col => col.id === id ? { ...col, visible: !col.visible } : col)
      })),
      resetLayout: () => set({
        columns: defaultColumns,
        order: defaultColumns.map(c => c.id),
        globalScale: 1,
      })
    }),
    {
      name: 'layout-storage',
      partialize: state => ({ columns: state.columns, order: state.order, globalScale: state.globalScale })
    }
  )
);
This store uses persist so that columns, order, and globalScale are saved in localStorage. (By default it uses localStorage if not specified
github.com
.) If we want to conditionally persist only for logged-in users, we might integrate the user ID into the storage name or use a different strategy as discussed.
b. Maintaining Sticky Headers/Columns with CSS
In your CSS (or styled components), you would include rules for sticky behavior:
css
Copy
/* Sticky header cells */
thead th {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  z-index: 1;
  background: #fff;  /* or another background matching the design */
}

/* Sticky first column cells (both th and td) */
.sticky-col {
  position: sticky;
  left: 0;
  z-index: 2;
  background: #fff;
}

/* If header intersection (the top-left cell) needs special handling: */
thead th.sticky-col {
  z-index: 3; /* ensure it’s above other sticky cells */
}
This CSS corresponds to techniques shown in sticky table tutorials
muhimasri.com
muhimasri.com
. The use of z-index is important when both header and column are sticky so that the header cell stays above the scrolling body cells, and the first column cells stay above other cells behind them. The background on sticky cells prevents underlying content from peeking through when they overlap.
c. Drag-and-Drop with dnd-kit Example
Using @dnd-kit, a minimal example for column dragging:
jsx
Copy
import { DndContext, useSensor, useSensors, PointerSensor, closestCenter } from '@dnd-kit/core';
import { SortableContext, useSortable, arrayMove } from '@dnd-kit/sortable';

function DraggableHeader({ colId, children }) {
  const { setNodeRef, attributes, listeners, isDragging } = useSortable({ id: colId });
  return (
    <th ref={setNodeRef} {...attributes} {...listeners} style={{ opacity: isDragging ? 0.5 : 1 }}>
      {children}
    </th>
  );
}

// In the main component rendering the table:
const sensors = useSensors(useSensor(PointerSensor));
<DndContext sensors={sensors} collisionDetection={closestCenter}
  onDragEnd={e => {
    const { active, over } = e;
    if (over && active.id !== over.id) {
      useLayoutStore.getState().moveColumn(active.id, over.id);
    }
  }}>
  <SortableContext items={orderArray}>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        {orderArray.map(colId => {
          if (!columnsById[colId].visible) return null;
          const stickyClass = colId === orderArray[0] ? 'sticky-col' : '';
          return (
            <DraggableHeader key={colId} colId={colId} className={stickyClass}>
              {unlocked 
                ? <Resizable ...>{columnsById[colId].label}</Resizable>
                : columnsById[colId].label}
            </DraggableHeader>
          );
        })}
      </tr>
    </thead>
    {/* tbody similar, but cells themselves not draggable, only headers */}
  </SortableContext>
</DndContext>
In this example:
We wrap the table (or at least the header) in DndContext and SortableContext from dnd-kit.
We use a PointerSensor for dragging with the pointer/mouse.
Each header cell uses useSortable to become a draggable item. The listeners and attributes spread give it the necessary event handlers and accessibility props. We can attach these to the entire <th> or a part of it (if we want only a drag handle icon inside the header to be the draggable region).
On drag end, we call our Zustand moveColumn to update state, using the IDs from active (dragged item) and over (dropped on item) to compute a new order. The arrayMove helper from dnd-kit could also be used if we had indexes, but here we manage by IDs.
The SortableContext items={orderArray} ensures dnd-kit knows the current order of sortable items.
Note: If using react-beautiful-dnd instead, the code differs (it uses a DragDropContext and Droppable/Draggable components), but the state update logic is similar.
d. Responsive Behavior Example
Using the earlier suggestion of ResizeObserver to adjust global scale, in a component:
jsx
Copy
const containerRef = useRef();
const setGlobalScale = useLayoutStore(s => s.setGlobalScale);

useLayoutStore(state => state.globalScale); // so we re-render on scale changes (if needed for styles)

useLayoutEffect(() => {
  const container = containerRef.current;
  if (!container) return;
  const observer = new ResizeObserver(([entry]) => {
    const width = entry.contentRect.width;
    if (width < 500) {
      setGlobalScale(0.7);
    } else if (width < 800) {
      setGlobalScale(0.85);
    } else {
      setGlobalScale(1);
    }
  });
  observer.observe(container);
  return () => observer.disconnect();
}, [setGlobalScale]);

return (
  <div ref={containerRef} className="table-container"> 
    {/* ...table as above... */}
  </div>
);
This will automatically adjust the globalScale state when the container’s width crosses certain thresholds (500px, 800px in this example). The concept is similar to dynamically changing component layout based on width as shown in responsive design tutorials
blog.logrocket.com
. We choose scale values that make sense (maybe making it quite small on very narrow screens to attempt to fit more columns). We could also trigger hiding of some columns here if needed:
js
Copy
if (width < 400) {
  // hide some columns for extreme small screens
  useLayoutStore.getState().toggleColumnVisibility('col10');
  // (or better, set a list of columns to hide via a dedicated action)
}
However, deciding which columns to hide might depend on content priority. Alternate Approach: Instead of dynamic JS, you could use pure CSS for some aspects:
css
Copy
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  .table-container { font-size: 0.8rem; }
  /* maybe hide certain columns by CSS class:
     if you tag less important columns with a class, you can do .hide-mobile { display: none; }
     But that wouldn't preserve sticky alignment easily unless you also hide corresponding <col>. 
     It's simpler to control visibility in React state.
  */
}
Using CSS alone to hide columns can be tricky because the DOM for those columns is still there taking space unless you also remove their width. So it might be better to handle via state (i.e., Zustand controlling visibility).
11. Reset and Guest vs User Handling
To reiterate best practices for reset and separating guest vs user:
Always have a source of truth for the default layout (hardcoded config or perhaps loaded from server in some cases). This default should be used to initialize guest sessions and to restore when needed.
When a user logs in and has no saved preferences yet, you might initialize their state with the default as well. Optionally, after they customize, you save it for next time.
Keep guest state non-persistent: either do not use persist at all for guests or if you do, ensure it’s cleared. For example, if using a single column-layout localStorage for both, a guest might accidentally pick up a previous user’s layout if we’re not careful. So using user-specific storage keys is important if the same device is shared.
The persist middleware in Zustand can store to sessionStorage or other storage too. If you wanted, you could persist guest changes in sessionStorage (so they last for that tab session but not beyond). But the problem statement says “always resets for guests”, implying no long-term memory for them. It’s safe to just not persist in their case.
On reset action for a logged-in user, if you want to clear their custom layout entirely, you might do:
js
Copy
useLayoutStore.getState().resetLayout();
localStorage.removeItem('zustand-column-layout'); // remove the saved item (key must match the persist name)
Then next time they load, they’d get defaults again rather than the previously saved. Alternatively, calling resetLayout and then letting persist update that key to default state is effectively the same (their localStorage will now contain the default state as the saved state). So either approach works.
Conclusion: We have outlined a robust strategy to implement the described system. By leveraging appropriate libraries (dnd-kit/react-dnd for dragging, react-resizable for resizing, a slider for scaling) and managing state with Zustand (including persistence control), we can create a highly dynamic table layout. Key considerations like keeping header and content in sync (via colgroup or grid), using CSS position: sticky for the frozen header/column, and handling responsiveness with scale or visibility adjustments ensure the component remains user-friendly across devices. Always test the interactions together – e.g., dragging after some columns resized, or scaling on a smaller screen – to fine-tune the behavior. With careful implementation of the above patterns, the 20-column adaptive layout will be flexible and maintainable, providing a great user experience. Sources:

Reasoned for 2m 18s
Below is a surgical‑scope refactor plan that limits the Reset Layout button to only the visual‑layout slice (column order  +  widths  +  visibility  +  global scale).
All verse data, user notes, highlights, bookmarks, prophecy caches, etc. remain intact.

1 · What “layout” means in your store
These are the relevant pieces already held in the Zustand store inside client/src/App.tsx:

Store slice	Purpose	Location in file	Keep on reset?
columnState.columns[]	slot · visible · widthRem for each column	lines ≈ 510‑560
RESET
sizeState.sizeMult	global text / column scale	lines ≈ 600‑610
RESET
translationState	main + alternate translations	lines ≈ 640‑690	KEEP
activeLabels, notes, crossRefs, …	user verse data	elsewhere in same file	KEEP

Rule: Reset only mutates columnState and sizeState, nothing else.

2 · Add a focused resetLayout() action
Rename the generic example action (if you copied my previous snippet) to avoid confusion.

Patch the existing store definition (around where you define actions such as toggleCrossRefs, toggleNotes, etc.).

ts
Copy
// ↓ add just below the other column actions
resetLayout: () => set(state => {
  // Immutable clones of original default layout
  const defaultColumns: ColumnInfo[] = [
    { slot: 0,  visible: true,  widthRem: 5  },  // Ref
    { slot: 1,  visible: false, widthRem: 16 },  // Notes
    { slot: 2,  visible: true,  widthRem: 20 },  // Main
    { slot: 3,  visible: false, widthRem: 18 },  // Alt1
    /* … keep the same default spec up to slot 19 … */
    { slot: 7,  visible: true,  widthRem: 15 },  // Cross‑Refs (ON)
    { slot: 8,  visible: false, widthRem: 5  },  // P
    { slot: 9,  visible: false, widthRem: 5  },  // F
    { slot: 10, visible: false, widthRem: 5  },  // V
    { slot: 11, visible: false, widthRem: 8  }   // Dates
  ];

  return {
    columnState: { ...state.columnState, columns: defaultColumns },
    sizeState:   { ...state.sizeState,   sizeMult: 1 }   // back to 100 %
  };
}),
Why this is safe
We spread the current columnState and sizeState so object identities stay unchanged (good for React memo hooks).

Only the two layout slices are overwritten, leaving verse caches and user artefacts untouched.

3 · Expose a Reset Layout UI control
Where your settings / hamburger menu lives:

tsx
Copy
import { useBibleStore } from '@/App';

const ResetLayoutButton = () => {
  const resetLayout = useBibleStore(s => s.resetLayout);
  return (
    <button
      className="px-3 py-1 rounded bg-rose-600 text-white text-sm"
      onClick={resetLayout}
    >
      Reset layout
    </button>
  );
};
Optional UX: Pop a confirmation if columnState.columns differs from defaults—compare arrays and only ask when needed.

4 · Memory‑light auto‑save every minute
4.1 · Persist only the layout slice
Add Zustand middleware that subscribes to changes and snapshots a minimal object:

ts
Copy
// utils/layoutPersistence.ts
const LAYOUT_KEY = 'bibleLayoutV1';

export function startLayoutAutosave(storeApi) {
  let saveTimeout: NodeJS.Timeout | null = null;

  storeApi.subscribe(
    state => ({ 
      cols: state.columnState.columns, 
      scale: state.sizeState.sizeMult 
    }),
    snapshot => {
      // debounce to 1 min
      if (saveTimeout) clearTimeout(saveTimeout);
      saveTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
        localStorage.setItem(LAYOUT_KEY, JSON.stringify(snapshot));
      }, 60_000);
    }
  );
}
Call it once after the store is created:

ts
Copy
const useBibleStore = create((set, get, api) => {
  /* … existing definition … */
  // after definition:
  startLayoutAutosave(api);
});
Because the snapshot only contains two small properties (columns[] is 12‑20 objects of 3 numbers each),
your payload is ~ 3 KB—trivial for localStorage and negligible GC overhead.

4.2 · Hydrate on load (logged‑in only)
ts
Copy
const saved = userIsLoggedIn
  ? localStorage.getItem(LAYOUT_KEY)
  : null;
if (saved) {
  const { cols, scale } = JSON.parse(saved);
  set(state => ({
    columnState: { ...state.columnState, columns: cols },
    sizeState:   { ...state.sizeState,   sizeMult: scale }
  }));
}
Place this hydration in an effect that runs after the user object is known.
Guests skip hydration → always default.

4.3 · Garbage collection
When the user hits Reset Layout, also wipe the autosave key so the next minutes tick will write a fresh default snapshot:

ts
Copy
resetLayout: () => set(state => {
  localStorage.removeItem(LAYOUT_KEY);
  /* … return default columns + sizeMult = 1 … */
}),
5 · Safety & Performance notes
Concern	Mitigation
Jank while typing	The subscription only watches the layout slice; notes/highlights editing never triggers the 60‑sec save.
Large JSON in localStorage	3‑4 KB worst‑case; well under 5 MB browser quota.
Overwrite collisions	Use the user‑scoped key: e.g. bibleLayout.<user.id> so shared devices don’t collide.
Mobile low‑memory browsers	60‑second debounce prevents thrashing; JSON stringify is tiny.

✅ Outcome
Reset Layout instantly restores the default guest view without touching any spiritual study artefacts.

A discreet one‑minute autosave remembers just the few numbers that define layout, keeping memory and storage impact near‑zero.

Hydration only happens for authenticated users; guests always see a clean default (or their per‑session tweaks until they reload).
