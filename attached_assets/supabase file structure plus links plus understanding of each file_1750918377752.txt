strongsverses.txt	(you can't see it in this text format but the Greek and Hebrew should be right characters) 	proper breakdowns of every verses origin language split in chunks for each word/term said, so that we can group them into connective blocks of text for each verse, when we double click on a verse and expand it, we load the verses origin words in an expanded view just like opening the menu. 
Then if we click on one of these word boxes, we load a global search bar, that shows all the verses with that word in it, that the user can scroll through. The user can just click the darkened space in the back to return, but there will be up and down arrows to to indicate clicking to move between verses if one wants to do it that way.

Gen.1:1 #In the beginning God (Elohim) created [by forming from nothing] the heavens and the earth.
Gen.1:2 #The earth was formless and void or a waste and emptiness, and darkness was upon the face of the deep [primeval ocean that covered the unformed earth]. The Spirit of God was moving (hovering, brooding) over the face of the waters.
Gen.1:3 #And God said, â€œLet there be lightâ€; and there was light.
Gen.1:4 #God saw that the light was good (pleasing, useful) and He affirmed and sustained it; and God separated the light [distinguishing it] from the darkness.
Gen.1:5 #And God called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.
Gen.1:6 #And God said, â€œLet there be an expanse [of the sky] in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters [below the expanse] from the waters [above the expanse].â€

Gen.1:10 #God called the dry land earth, and the gathering of the waters He called seas; and God saw that this was good (pleasing, useful) and He affirmed and sustained it.
