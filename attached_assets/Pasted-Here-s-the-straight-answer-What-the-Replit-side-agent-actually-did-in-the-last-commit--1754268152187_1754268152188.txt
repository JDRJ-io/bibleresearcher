Here’s the straight answer:

* **What the Replit-side agent actually did in the last “commit”**
  From the diff you showed he only **commented-out code in `AuthContext.tsx`** (green lines beginning with `//`).
  He did **not** change anything else that matters to `useMyProfile` or `Profile.tsx`.

* **Did that satisfy the steps I asked for?**
  Partly.  Commenting-out the old profile loader in `AuthContext` was the right first move, **but**:

  1. The agent left a reference to the (now-disabled) state in the context’s `return` statement.
     That means `Profile.tsx` is still reading `profileLoading` from the context instead of from our hook, so the spinner never clears.
  2. He did not touch `Profile.tsx` to remove the old context props.

So yes—he mostly inserted comments; he didn’t wire the page to the new hook all the way.

### One decisive fix

1. **Open `Profile.tsx`.**
   Change the import:

   ```diff
   - import { useAuth } from '@/contexts/AuthContext';
   + import { useAuth } from '@/contexts/AuthContext';   // keep for user/session
   + import { useMyProfile } from '@/hooks/useMyProfile';
   ```

2. **Replace the line that pulls `profileLoading` and `profile` from
   context** with the ones from our hook:

   ```diff
   - const { user, loading: authLoading, profile, profileLoading } = useAuth();
   + const { user, loading: authLoading } = useAuth();
   + const { profile, profileLoading, error, save } = useMyProfile();
   ```

3. Remove any leftover `error`, `save`, etc. that came from the context
   (they’re now provided by the hook).

4. Leave the commented-out block in **`AuthContext.tsx`** as is; it no longer
   exports `profile` or `profileLoading`, so there’s no conflict.

5. Save → restart → hard-refresh `/profile`.

You should finally see the three console lines:

```
HOOK FILE LOADED
USER ↩️ { id:'…' … } null
PROFILE ↩️ { … } null
```

and the spinner will disappear.

If those logs show up and you still get a permission error (`code: 42501`)
paste that exact line and we’ll apply the SQL policy once—otherwise the page
is fixed.
