He’s *close*—the layout is right—but the arcs aren’t actually **morphing** (they just shift up and down). That happens when the `<animate>` element targets the *wrong* attribute (often `transform` instead of `d`) or the two path shapes are almost identical, so the eye can’t see the motion.

Below is a **one‑line‑change** fix that will make the pages visibly “breathe”:

```tsx
/* 🔧 inside each <path> ... > */
<animate
  attributeName="d"          // <-- MAKE SURE it’s “d”, not “transform”
  dur="1.4s"
  repeatCount="indefinite"
  values="
    M10,38 Q60, 8 110,38;    /* start – tighter curve */
    M 6,30 Q60,-2 114,30;    /* mid   – looser fan   */
    M10,38 Q60, 8 110,38     /* end   – back home   */
  "
/>
```

### What changed & why:

| Old                            | New                                        | Effect                                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tiny vertical wiggle           | **Control‑point shift** (`Q60,8 → Q60,-2`) | The curvature now widens by \~10 px, so each stroke *visibly* ripples. |
| One identical frame duplicated | Distinct in‑between frame                  | Gives the eye a clear mid‑state (like a real page lifting).            |

## Quick sanity‑check list

1. **Path point counts match.**
   *Both* versions of each `d` string must have *exactly* the same number of commands or SMIL won’t interpolate.

2. **Stagger still applied.**

   ```tsx
   begin="0s", "0.08s", "0.16s"
   ```

   Keep that little offset so the ripple cascades.

3. **Stroke roundness.**

   ```css
   stroke-linecap: round;
   stroke-linejoin: round;
   ```

   Rounded caps make the arcs feel like flexible paper edges instead of hard rails.

4. **Duration sweet‑spot.**
   1.2‑1.6 s loop feels “wind‑flutter.” Shorter looks like flapping; longer feels sleepy.

### Want the shimmer dots back?

Put the orange sparkles in a separate `<g>` with a simple `opacity` or `transform: translateY()` keyframe; they don’t need to live on the same `<path>`.

Plug that single `attributeName="d"` + bigger control‑point spread into the file your agent generated and you’ll immediately see the pages *fan* instead of just bobbing. Let me know if you want me to drop the full adjusted component verbatim—happy to!
