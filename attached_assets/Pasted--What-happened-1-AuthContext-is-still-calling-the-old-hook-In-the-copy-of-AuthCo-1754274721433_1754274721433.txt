**What happened**

1. **`AuthContext` is still calling the *old* hook**
   In the copy of *AuthContext.tsx* that the app is compiling you can see:

   ```ts
   const { profile, profileLoading, error, save } = useMyProfile();
   ```

   ‚Äî there are **zero arguments** being passed.

2. **The hook implementation the bundler is using didn‚Äôt change either**
   The exported function still has no parameters and it continues to read `user` from `useAuth()` inside the hook.
   That recreates the circular-dependency we talked about, so the effect bails out while `authLoading === true` and `profileLoading` never flips to `false`, which is why the Profile page logs `{ loading: true }`.

   > The screenshot you pasted shows an edited file, but Replit is still compiling a different copy (or an earlier save) that lives on the same path.

### How to get out of the loop in five minutes

| üìÑ File                                   | ‚úÖ Should look like                                                                        |                                                                                         |                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`client/src/hooks/useMyProfile.ts`**    | \`\`\`ts<br>export function useMyProfile(user: User                                       | null, authLoading: boolean) {<br>  const \[profile, setProfile] = useState\<ProfileData | null>(null);<br>  ‚Ä¶ // **remove** useAuth(), keep the effect exactly the same<br>}<br>\`\`\` |
| **`client/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`** | `ts<br>const { profile, profileLoading, error, save } = useMyProfile(user, loading);<br>` |                                                                                         |                                                                                              |

Make sure **only one copy** of each file exists (Replit sometimes keeps an earlier lowercase/uppercase duplicate). Then run a hard restart (‚åò/Ctrl-R on the preview or `npm run dev` restart).

Once the correct hook is in use you‚Äôll finally see the console line:

```
PROFILE ‚Ü©Ô∏è { name: null, bio: null, tier: 'free' } null
```

and `loading` will turn `false`, allowing the Profile page to render.

### Two quick lint fixes while you‚Äôre there

1. `save()` in the hook currently reads
   `update({ .update, updated_at: ‚Ä¶ })` ‚Äî that dot is a syntax error. Replace with

   ```ts
   .update({ ...update, updated_at: new Date().toISOString() })
   ```

2. Since you set `emailRedirectTo` to `/auth/callback`, but the callback immediately redirects with ‚ÄúNo auth code found‚Äù, you can drop the custom page and use

   ```ts
   emailRedirectTo: window.location.origin
   ```

   in **sendMagicLink**; Supabase will restore the session automatically and the console noise goes away.

Do those two edits, delete any stray duplicate files, restart the dev server, and your profile (including the `tier` upgrade logic) should start working. If the spinner still persists, share the fresh console trace and I‚Äôll help you trace the next link in the chain.
