STEP 1 — LOCATE ONLY (don’t code yet)

Reply with exactly these sections:

1) LOCATE_PROOF

TopNav (white bar):

Visual: back/forward buttons on the far left → blue circular scroll logo → “Anointed.io” brand text → search field → icons → Sign In.

Code target: file path + component name that renders this bar (e.g., client/src/components/TopHeader.tsx or similar).

Paste a ≤10-line JSX snippet that includes the brand group you will change.

UpdatesBanner (gradient bar):

Visual: left pill with small scroll icon → “Divine Updates” (amber/orange, bold) → • bullet → “Latest sacred enhancements” (muted) → right pill “View Updates”.

Code target: file path + component name (e.g., client/src/components/UpdatesBanner.tsx).

Paste a ≤10-line JSX snippet that includes the left icon + titles and the right “View Updates” button.

2) MICRO_PLAN
3–5 bullets for what you’ll change (per bar), plus the exact files you’ll edit (aim ≤3 total).

3) TESTS
Bulleted steps you will perform to prove the change (open app, visual checks listed below).

Wait for my approval before coding.

Master spec (what to implement in STEP 2)
A) TopNav (white bar)

Brand group (left)

Order: ◀ ▶ [blue circle logo] "Anointed.io"

Logo: 36px circle, deep blue (#1E40AF ~ #1D4ED8); the scroll glyph points upward (rotate if needed) and is white.

Text: “Anointed.io” 20–22px, 700 weight, color #111, letter-spacing -0.01em, 8–10px gap from logo.

Search field: remains to the right of brand, width ~520–560px on desktop (keep your current behavior if close).

Misc icons & Sign In: unchanged alignment; keep right side controls as-is.

Spacing: 12–16px gap between items; keep the bar height consistent with the master.

B) UpdatesBanner (gradient bar, just under TopNav)

Background gradient: left-to-right violet→gold→pink (approx)
linear-gradient(90deg, #D8C4F8 0%, #FAEDC5 50%, #EEC8D7 100%) with subtle inner highlight (ok to mimic with a light translucent white overlay).

Left group:

Small pill with a pale yellow badge and the scroll icon.

“Divine Updates” in amber/orange (#D97706, 700 weight).

A • bullet (neutral gray #6B7280).

“Latest sacred enhancements” in muted gray (#374151/#4B5563).

Right side: pill button “View Updates” (no caret); amber text, soft glass pill.

Keep the banner height close to the master (about 56px total) and content vertically centered.
