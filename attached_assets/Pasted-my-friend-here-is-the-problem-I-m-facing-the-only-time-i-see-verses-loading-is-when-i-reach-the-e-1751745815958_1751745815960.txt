my friend here is the problem I'm facing

the only time i see verses loading is when i reach the end of the verse box boundary, then i can scroll past it but verses keep loading when i touch around at the end of the box. For some reason verses are loading at the end of the box, instead of based on where the center verse is

here's how i believe we're gonna solve it



Direct actions to get seamless, centre-anchored scrolling
Hand the component one immutable list of all verse keys (31 102).
verses must always have length 31 102.
Each element: { key: "Gen.1:1", text?: string }.
Leave text undefined until its row first appears, then fill it from Supabase.

Result: verses[index] is never undefined, so pool rows always have something to render.

Fetch verse text on-demand, not entire slices.
Inside fillRowContent(row, v) →
If v.text is missing, kick off a background fetch (or pull from a memoised Map) and update only that verse object when it returns.
No changes to array length means no virtual-scroll math breaks.

Change visible-window math to centre-based.

Edit
currentVerseIndex = floor((scrollTop + viewportH/2) / ROW_HEIGHT)
start = max(0, currentVerseIndex – VIEWPORT_BUFFER)
end   = min(totalRows-1, currentVerseIndex + viewportVerseCount + VIEWPORT_BUFFER)
That mirrors the prototype: rows load before the eye reaches them.

Mutate, don’t remount, <VerseRow>.
In renderRowPool() stop returning <VerseRow …/>.
Instead, for each pooled wrapper:

move its top,

call a helper that sets innerText / props via ref,

update notes / highlights via a lightweight context or direct DOM.

Result: DOM nodes never disappear, so the user can’t scroll into a blank frame.

Pull header out of React state completely.
Remove scrollLeft prop from ColumnHeaders.
In scroll handler:

js
Copy
Edit
headerRef.current.style.transform =
    `translateX(-${scrollElement.scrollLeft}px)`;
No React re-render → rows update the same frame.

Add anchor preserve on option changes.

Remember verse index at viewport centre before toggling notes / prophecy or changing font size.

After the UI update finishes, set scrollTop = index × ROW_HEIGHT.

The verse you were reading never jumps.
