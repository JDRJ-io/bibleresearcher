# VirtualBibleTable Log Analysis

## Current Status
Looking at the console logs, the VirtualBibleTable appears to be working correctly:

1. **Table is rendering**: 
   - `⏱️ VirtualBibleTable render #201 at +9430ms` - Shows the table has rendered 201 times
   - Table has been running for over 9 seconds without unmounting

2. **No errors detected**:
   - No "❌ VirtualBibleTable UNMOUNTING" messages
   - No "❌ ERROR" messages
   - No crash logs

3. **Data is valid**:
   - `hasUndefinedText: false` - All verses have defined text
   - `hasNullVerses: false` - No null verses
   - `visibleVersesLength: 41` - Proper number of verses visible
   - `firstVisible: "Ps 102:10"` - Table is showing Psalm 102:10

## The Flash Issue
Based on your description of "flashing once then never shows again", this might be happening:

1. The table IS rendering (logs confirm this)
2. But it might be positioned off-screen or hidden by CSS
3. Or it could be covered by another element

## Next Steps to Debug
Let me check if the table is actually visible in the DOM...
